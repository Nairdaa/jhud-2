* `Strafe Speed(JSS)` - A metric to how your strafe speed differs to the ideal strafe speed.
* `Strafe Analyzer` - A addition that shows an arrow indicating that your strafe is too fast or too slow.
* `Customization` - You can customize how this appears on your screen vastly. You can change the color rendered on the messages based on your speed or gain for that jump. You can change between if a less important range of jumps are color coordinated based on speed values.
